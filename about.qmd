I am a medical imaging research scientist developing open source software for clinical translation of new techniques. The openimaging.ai blog will be used to post code, ideas, wrong turns taken, and lessons I've learned in this pursuit. Hopefully it will contain information that is helpful to others with an interest in this field. If you find any bugs or issues, have ideas or code to contribute, please reach out to me via github.
